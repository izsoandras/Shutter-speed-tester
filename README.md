# Shutter-speed-tester
Test device for measuring shutterspeed of analog cameras.
Idea from: https://github.com/hiroshootsfilm/shutterspeedtester

## Usage
1. Open up the back of the camera
2. Place a strong light on one side
3. Place the tester with the phototransistor facing the direction of the light on the other side
4. Release the shutter

Tipps for usage:
- use widest aperture
- try both with light on the front and tester on the back and vice-versa
- The comparating level is marked with a dashed line, the tester measures the pulse width when the signal is above that
